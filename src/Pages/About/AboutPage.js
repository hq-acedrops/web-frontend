            AceDrops is an initiative to give platform to those thousands of small business owners who have been operating on social media platforms such as Instagram, whatsapp and facebook.
            A place where they can over-shadoww the brands and overcome the reselleing traps and identity threft. At Acedrops, we offer more than 9 categories for seller to list their products.<br/>
            From painting to thrift shops, from crystal decoratives to hand stiched wearables, home decoratives to jewelleries and many more. A seller can sign up for free on our seller app and 
            get their own storefront on our platform with a unique name and bio. <br/><br/>
            Our vision for buyers is to provide a secure shopping and facilities like customization option which could have been never achived while shopping on social media, as there was no security with their money and 
            no gurantee of refunds in case the products fails to impress them.
